# TurIA · Smart Tourism for Local Businesses

**TurIA** is an experimental web application powered by **GitHub Copilot** and **OpenAI**, designed to build a smart tourism platform focused on local businesses, municipalities, and associations in Valencia, Spain.  
This project is being developed as part of the GitHub Skills course: *Build Applications with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode*.

## 🚀 What are we building?

We are combining the power of **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** with the **OpenAI API** to build a full-stack application that:

- Analyzes public data from OpenDataValencia, Google Places, TripAdvisor, and more.
- Identifies tourist profiles by language, nationality, and interests.
- Predicts tourist influx behavior across different areas.
- Generates smart recommendations and actionable strategies using generative AI.

---

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Copilot Agent Mode**: AI-assisted code generation in GitHub Codespaces
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: for semantic analysis and smart suggestion generation
- **Astro.js** or **Next.js** (to be defined)
- **Supabase**: authentication and database (MVP version)
- **TailwindCSS**: fast and responsive UI styling
- **DatoCMS** (optional): for future multibrand content management

## 🤖 Why GitHub Copilot?

This project is part of a GitHub Skills training course to explore **Copilot Agent Mode**, an advanced way to interact with generative models within a modern development workflow.  
Instead of just generating snippets, Copilot helps build **full applications** based on natural language prompts.

## 📡 OpenAI Integration

We are using OpenAI GPT-4o to:

- Analyze tourist review sentiment
- Generate multilingual responses and summaries
- Suggest products or offers based on visitor profiles
- Predict local tourism opportunities at the neighborhood level
